  # aif - anaphoric if.
  #
  # English is nice, in that if you want to make a conditional, you can say 
  # "if the dog is on fire, then put it out!" to say the equivalent thing in Ruby 
  # you say "if the dog is on fire, then put the dog out." - which is fine, if something
  # of a hassle sometimes.  The "it" in the first example is an anaphor - 
  # 
  # @param [Object] result - any object, although it generally take the form of an expression.
  # @return [Object, FalseClass] returns the results of the block if the paramater was
  #   truthy (ie, it wasn't `nil` or `false`) or FalseClass if it wasn't
  # @yield [Object] yields the parameter into a block if it's truthy, the block can optionally return
  #   a different value, which will become the return value of #aif
  def aif result = true, &block
    if result
      unless block.nil? then result = block.call(*[result].slice(0,block.arity)) end

  # switch - anaphoric case construct
  #
  # this is basically a form of sugar over a whole list of || operators or +or+ statements
  # @example
  #   thing = switch do
  #     on object.quick_method_that_might_return_nil
  #     on object.medium_method_that_might_return_nil
  #     on object.slow_method_that_might_return_nil
  #     on { raise 'everything returned nil!' }
  #   end
  #   # thing will be equal to results of the first method that 
  #   # didn't return nil
  # 
  # This prevents you from either writing a difficult to read list of || operators, or
  # having to construct lazily evaluated list of methods and parameters in order to do
  # the cheapest thing.
  # @param [Object] object - 
  #   parameter of all +on+ calls will be compared to this object using +===+
  # @yield A block during which the +on+ method will be available - the block is required.
  #   The block is always executed in the context of the receiver of the +switch+ method
  #   so most of the time this is +self+ but if you call +switch+ with an explicit receiver
  #   it acts somewhat like the {Object#tap} method
  # @raise [ArgumentError] I tried to tell you the callable or block was required
  # @return [Object, FalseClase] the results of the first call to +on+ that returned 
  #   anything truthy, or of its block
